        <h1>Week 2 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt semantic web and the elements used inside.</p>
        <p>Some elements used inside are: header, nav, article, section, table and aside tags.</p>
        <p>These tags will be able group the codes in the different section they belong so that the code can look more organized.</p>
        <p>Another thing I learn is that the div elements does not represent anything, it just used to group elements for styling purposes and it can only be used 
        when no other semantic element is appropriate.
        </p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learnt how to use css and also the link the css file to th html file so that the css can work in the html file.</p>
        <p>One of the CSS rule is that curly braces, all styles inside these will apply to the HTML elements that belong to the selector.</p>
        <p>I also learnt how to change color to p and heading tags.</p>
        <p>And also The "#" is how you tell CSS "this is an id.” while The "." is how you tell CSS "this is a class name."</p>
        <p>I also learn how to change the typography by importing the text from google fonts.</p>

        <h1>Week 3 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt more css queries, flex box, forms and z-index and also to make wireframes in Adobe XD.</p>
        <p>The HTML form tag is required when you want to collect information that visitors provide. For example, you may want to collect specific data from visitors, such as name, email address, and password. The HTML form tag is used to create a form.</p>
        <p>The input tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. The input element is the most important form element. The input element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute. The different input types are as follows: input type="button".</p>
        <p>Another thing I learn is that we can apply Flexbox styling to any HTML element, which means that we can easily restyle and reflow elements independently of each other as there is no fixed container hierarchy like there is in tables.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learnt how to use css and also the link the css file to th html file so that the css can work in the html file when doing the form and flex box to position the items to absolute, relative and fixed.</p>
        <p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.</p>
        <p>I also learnt to do wireframe in Adobe XD to make the websites.</p>

        <h1>Week 4 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt this week on how to do responsive images such as viewing websites in desktop and mobile views.</p>
        <p>Having responsive images will auto-resize based on screen size, better performance such as having load higher resolution images only when needed and also load higher resolution images only when needed.</p>
        <p>We can achieve responsive images by setting a relative unit, we make our images fluid and they will resize accordingly.</p>
        <p>I also practised doing to achieve a max-width which property sets a maximum width for an element, which does not allow the width of that element to be larger than its max-width value which we can make it smaller too.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>If I want to acieve a image to not be larger but stick to the original size is by having is to have the max-width to be 100% and the width to be 400 px.</p>
        <p>I also learnt on how to fit images to the box by putting the background-size as cover.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I also learnt how to do text overlay in the additional challenge by using the div tag and styling it in the style. From there, I added the text and changed the background to tansparent so its easier to read.</p>

        <h1>Week 5 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt this week on how to do javascript in websites.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language of the web.</p>
        <p>The web changes static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling—frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. </p>
        <p>I also practised doing doing javascript while watching the Linkedin Learning wheere we need to learn to import files and do the javascript as shown in the video.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>When doing the practice, I was able to see how JavaScript is now becoming an important of the web, infusing every layer with its script.</p>

        <h1>Week 6 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt this week on how to do javascript objects and DOM.</p>
        <p>A variable is a nmaed container for a value which is used to store, manioulate & retrive data. The name of the variable can be anything so long as it is meaningful but it also must follow the camelcase naming convection which is also why each varaibles have a unique name.</p>
        <p>I also learn that there's 3 primitive data types which are numbers: floating point numbers, decimals & integars, strings: sequence of characters, text and finally booleans: Logical Data (True or False).</p>
        <p>There asre also two other primitivedata types which are undefined: data type of variable that does not have a value yet and null: also means non-existent</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learned of Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model which is also used to model the real world. </p>
        <p>Literal objects has no constructors while Function-based objects has a constructor, Literal objects cannot be inherited while function-based objects can be inherited but is very messy and out of scope here </p>
        <p>Literal objects is also best used for “one off” objects where only one copy will exist while for Function-based its Best use for stuff that you want to instantiate again and again) </p>
        <p>Literal objects is a colon separates the key/value pair while FUNCTION-BASED OBJECTS is The this keyword is used instead of the object name</p>
        <p>Literal objects For global or configuration objects like 'game settings' while function based - objects is if you have alot of objects with similar functionality </p>
        <p>I also learnt about DOM which is when a browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM Tree.</p>
        <p>When we wrok with dom we locate the node theat represents the element you want to work with</p>
        <p>Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.</p>
