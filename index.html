        <h1>Week 2 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt semantic web and the elements used inside.</p>
        <p>Some elements used inside are: header, nav, article, section, table and aside tags.</p>
        <p>These tags will be able group the codes in the different section they belong so that the code can look more organized.</p>
        <p>Another thing I learn is that the div elements does not represent anything, it just used to group elements for styling purposes and it can only be used 
        when no other semantic element is appropriate.
        </p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learnt how to use css and also the link the css file to th html file so that the css can work in the html file.</p>
        <p>One of the CSS rule is that curly braces, all styles inside these will apply to the HTML elements that belong to the selector.</p>
        <p>I also learnt how to change color to p and heading tags.</p>
        <p>And also The "#" is how you tell CSS "this is an id.” while The "." is how you tell CSS "this is a class name."</p>
        <p>I also learn how to change the typography by importing the text from google fonts.</p>

        <h1>Week 3 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt more css queries, flex box, forms and z-index and also to make wireframes in Adobe XD.</p>
        <p>The HTML form tag is required when you want to collect information that visitors provide. For example, you may want to collect specific data from visitors, such as name, email address, and password. The HTML form tag is used to create a form.</p>
        <p>The input tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. The input element is the most important form element. The input element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute. The different input types are as follows: input type="button".</p>
        <p>Another thing I learn is that we can apply Flexbox styling to any HTML element, which means that we can easily restyle and reflow elements independently of each other as there is no fixed container hierarchy like there is in tables.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learnt how to use css and also the link the css file to th html file so that the css can work in the html file when doing the form and flex box to position the items to absolute, relative and fixed.</p>
        <p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.</p>
        <p>I also learnt to do wireframe in Adobe XD to make the websites.</p>

        <h1>Week 4 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt this week on how to do responsive images such as viewing websites in desktop and mobile views.</p>
        <p>Having responsive images will auto-resize based on screen size, better performance such as having load higher resolution images only when needed and also load higher resolution images only when needed.</p>
        <p>We can achieve responsive images by setting a relative unit, we make our images fluid and they will resize accordingly.</p>
        <p>I also practised doing to achieve a max-width which property sets a maximum width for an element, which does not allow the width of that element to be larger than its max-width value which we can make it smaller too.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>If I want to acieve a image to not be larger but stick to the original size is by having is to have the max-width to be 100% and the width to be 400 px.</p>
        <p>I also learnt on how to fit images to the box by putting the background-size as cover.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I also learnt how to do text overlay in the additional challenge by using the div tag and styling it in the style. From there, I added the text and changed the background to tansparent so its easier to read.</p>

        <h1>Week 5 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt this week on how to do javascript in websites.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language of the web.</p>
        <p>The web changes static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling—frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. </p>
        <p>I also practised doing doing javascript while watching the Linkedin Learning wheere we need to learn to import files and do the javascript as shown in the video.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>When doing the practice, I was able to see how JavaScript is now becoming an important of the web, infusing every layer with its script.</p>

        <h1>Week 6 Blog</h1>
        <p> I have learnt this week on how to do javascript objects and DOM.</p>
        <p>A variable is a nmaed container for a value which is used to store, manioulate & retrive data. The name of the variable can be anything so long as it is meaningful but it also must follow the camelcase naming convection which is also why each varaibles have a unique name.</p>
        <p>I also learn that there's 3 primitive data types which are numbers: floating point numbers, decimals & integars, strings: sequence of characters, text and finally booleans: Logical Data (True or False).</p>
        <p>There asre also two other primitivedata types which are undefined: data type of variable that does not have a value yet and null: also means non-existent</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learned of Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model which is also used to model the real world. </p>
        <p>Literal objects has no constructors while Function-based objects has a constructor, Literal objects cannot be inherited while function-based objects can be inherited but is very messy and out of scope here </p>
        <p>Literal objects is also best used for “one off” objects where only one copy will exist while for Function-based its Best use for stuff that you want to instantiate again and again) </p>
        <p>Literal objects is a colon separates the key/value pair while FUNCTION-BASED OBJECTS is The this keyword is used instead of the object name</p>
        <p>Literal objects For global or configuration objects like 'game settings' while function based - objects is if you have alot of objects with similar functionality </p>
        <p>I also learnt about DOM which is when a browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM Tree.</p>
        <p>When we wrok with dom we locate the node theat represents the element you want to work with</p>
        <p>Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.</p>

        <h1>Week 7 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt how do events and how to handle events and also Local Storage where we store data on the browser</p>
        <p>When you browse the web, the browser register different types of events where it's the browser way of saying "Hey, this just happened" & your script responds to these events.</p>
        <p>Event Listener with no parameters where element DOM element node to target, while event inside the bracket, where the code is the name of function to call while event flow indicates something called capture, and is usually set to false.</p>
        <p>Event Object, when an event occurs, the event object tells information about the event, and the element it happened upon.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>Some events such as clicking on a link or submitting a form, brings the user to another page.</p>
        <p>How to validate, add event handler to the keyUp event, Add event handler to the blur event and add event handler to the submit and other things.</p>
        <p>HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string</p>
        <p>The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string.</p>
        <p>If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript data type.</p>
        <p> There are two types of storage: local and session storage. They are implemented using the localStorage and sessionStorage objects. Commonly used in place of cookies.</p>
        <p>Both local and session storage have the same methods to get and set data, but each lasts a different amount of time.</p>
        <p>Most browser store up to 5MB of data per domain in a storage object.</p>
        <p> Should a site require more than the 5MB of data, typically the browser will ask the user for permission to store more data (never rely on users agreeing to give a site more space)</p>
        <p>For security protection, browsers employ a same origin policy, which means that data can only be accessed by other pages in the same origin</p>

        <h1>Week 8 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt how to do jQuery to make things faster and also about API which is to leverage on others.</p>
        <p>In jQuery, I learnt about scripts which is when a browser starts to download a Javascript file, it stops all downloads and pauses to lay the page until the script has finished loading which is why we place the script at the end of the page before closing the body tag so that it will not affect the rendering of the page.</p>
        <p>How to use place the scripts? Whe placed in the head tag, it is to be best avoided as pages will load slowly. DOM content is not loaded when the script is executed so you have to wait for an event like load or DOMContentLoaded to trigger your functions
        If you muse use a script tag element with the head of the page, use it just before the closing </head> tag </p>
        <p>Whereas in the page, its also best avoided as the head and the pages seem slower to load too but certain javascript calls might not work as we coul be referencing elements above the script</p>
        <p>Before the closing body tag, the script is not blocking other things from downloading. The DOM has already loaded by the time the script is executed.</p>
        <p>As for jQuery, I was able to learn that we can select or find elements, update their content,size,visibility and also simplify event handling.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>In API, I was able to learn about AJAX is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page. The data is often sent in a format called JavaScript  Object Notation (or JSON)
        It the ability to load new content into part of a page improves the user experience because the user does not have to wait for an entire page to load if only a portion of the page is being updated.</p>
        <p> I also learnt about FETCH which is by fetching a JSON file across the network and printing it to the console. The simplest use of fetch takes on arguement - the path to the resourse yo want to fetch and returns a promise containing the response ( a Response object). </p>
        <p>AJAX = Asynchronous Javascript and XML. Technique for creating fast & dynamic web page 
        Allows web pages or content to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. </p>

        <h1>Week 9 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt about Bootstrap which is a software used to develop faster user intereface designs.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap is used by many web developers who also wanted to find a quicker solution creating User Interfaces in a faster way. </p>
        <p>It's also commonly used to resolve all the nooks and crannies imposed by all the various browsers and devices.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap is one software to use that allows us to simplify our develpment process.</p>
        <p>Some bootstrap uses is making a flexbox grid for its layout, rem for measurements and has device breakpoints to accommodate for diiferent media sizes.</p>
        <p>Another thing I learnt is Bootstrap Grid, which helps to create a layout and easily build a responsive websites. </p>
        <p>I also learnt about Charts, which is used to easily visulize datas, allows comparisons, data visualization and identify patterns and trends.</p>
        <p>The difference betweens tables and charts is that table is we need to compare or look up individual values, require precise values, values that invlove multiple units of measure and has data to communicate information that doesn't consists of trends while for charts is  used to convey a message that is contained in the shape of data which is also used to show a relationship between many values.</p>
        <p>There are many different types of charts such as line charts, radar charts and pie&donut charts.</p>
        <p>Line charts is a way of plotting data points on a line and is used to show trend data, or the comparison of two data sets.</p>
        <p>Radar charts is a way of showing mutliple data points and the variation between them. They are often useful for comparing the points of two or more different data sets.</p>
        <p>Finaly, pie & donut is divided into segments, the arc of each segment shows the porportional value of each piece of data, they are excellent at shwoing relational proportions between data.</p>

        
        <h1>Week 12 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt about using RESTDB and also about NoSql.</p>
        <p>I learnt that SQL which is also know as Structured Query Language is the core of the relational database which is used for accessing and managing the databases </p>
        <p>SQl language is used to manipulate and retrieve data from a structured data format in the form of tables and holds relationships with those tables and some common SQL is MYSQL AND MSSQL</p>
        <p>There's also NoSQL which is also known as Not only SQL database, provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of unstructured data.</p>
        <p>This type of database can handle a humongous amount of data and has a dynamic schema. So, a NoSQL database has no specific query language, no or a very few relationships, but has data stored in the format of collections and documents.</p>
        <p>A database can have a ‘n’ number of collections and each collection can have ‘m‘ number of documents</p>
        <p>Some differences of SQL and NoSql is that SQL is best fit for data with tables and rows while NoSql is besr fit for ustructered data, SQL works better for small datasets while NoSQL works better for large datasets and lastly, SQL is able to have frequent updates while NoSQL h=have high write loads.</p>
        <p> I also learnt how to use RESTDB where I created databases and inside the database I created a collabration to add new fields that is required in the web page.</p>
        <p>From there, I did the changes to the fields by changing the name and also ticking the required check box following that, I went to API details to create API key for the site.</p>
        <p>From there, I was I copied the API key and also the url link given to my site so that the fields in my website can works when users uses it.</p>
